Hello! ðŸ‘‹ 

Experienced software engineer with a Bachelor's Degree in Computer Science and one year of experience in object-oriented languages like C#, scripting languages including Python and JavaScript, and web development using HTML/CSS. Additionally, has worked on side projects involving full-stack development using Python with Tkinter for desktop applications and JavaScript with React.js/Bootstrap for website development.

My previous experience as a teacher has given me a unique perspective in the world of technology. I understand the importance of clear communication, collaboration, and empathy when it comes to building software that serves its users.  I am excited about the potential that technology has to create meaningful solutions and make a positive impact on the world.

Feel free to check out my repositories and projects, and don't hesitate to contact me if you have any questions or if you're interested in collaborating on a project!
